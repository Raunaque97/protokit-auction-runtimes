# Auction runtime-modules

Trying out Protokit (a zk-AppChain verified on mina) by implementing all types of auctions.
English Auction, Dutch Auction, and even **Sealed Bid Auctions**

For enabling sealed bids, experimenting with private tokens [WIP]

PrivateToken runtime.
One can deposit normal tokens, wait for other transactions like tornado cash to increase anonymity. Then, withdraw to a private token system, where the user balances are hidden, but unlike Zcash transfer addresses are visible and the client Wallets only needs to store the private key no other data is necessary. Also, its account based so can be easily used with other runtimes/zkApps.
